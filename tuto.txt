In a Django project, you write your application code in the following places:

Views: Define the logic of your application in the views.py file inside your app directory (e.g., myapp/views.py).

Models: Define the data structure of your application in the models.py file inside your app directory (e.g., myapp/models.py).

URLs: Map URLs to views in the urls.py file inside your app directory (e.g., myapp/urls.py). You also configure the project's URLs in myproject/urls.py.

Templates: Create HTML templates for rendering views in the templates directory inside your app or project.

Static Files: Add static files (like CSS, JavaScript, and images) in the static directory inside your app or project.

Forms: Define forms in the forms.py file inside your app directory (if needed).
